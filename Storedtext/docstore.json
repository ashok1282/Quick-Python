Having bowed down to Narayana and Nara, the most exalted male being, and also to the goddess Saraswati, must the \nword Jaya be uttered. \n \nUgrasrava, the son of Lomaharshana, surnamed Sauti, well-versed in the Puranas, bending with humility, one day approached \nthe great sages of rigid vows, sitting at their ease, who had attended the twelve years' sacrifice of Saunaka, surnamed Kulapati, \nin the forest of Naimisha. Those ascetics, wishing to hear his wonderful narrations, presently began to address him who had \nthus arrived at that recluse abode of the inhabitants of the forest of Naimisha. Having been entertained with due respect by \nthose holy men, he saluted those Munis (sages) with joined palms, even all of them, and inquired about the progress of their \nasceticism. Then all the ascetics being again seated, the son of Lomaharshana humbly occupied the seat that was assigned to \nhim. Seeing that he was comfortably seated, and recovered from fatigue, one of the Rishis beginning the conversation, asked \nhim, 'Whence comest thou, O lotus-eyed Sauti, and where hast thou spent the time? Tell me, who ask thee, in detail.' \n \nAccomplished in speech, Sauti, thus questioned, gave in the midst of that big assemblage of contemplative Munis a full and \nproper answer in words consonant with their mode of life. \n \n\"Sauti said, 'Having heard the diverse sacred and wonderful stories which were composed in his Mahabharata by Krishna-\nDwaipayana, and which were recited in full by Vaisampayana at the Snake-sacrifice of the high-souled royal sage Janamejaya \nand in the presence also of that chief of Princes, the son of Parikshit, and having wandered about, visiting many sacred waters \nand holy shrines, I journeyed to the country venerated by the Dwijas (twice-born) and called Samantapanchaka where formerly \nwas fought the battle between the children of Kuru and Pandu, and all the chiefs of the land ranged on either side. Thence, \nanxious to see you, I am come into your presence. Ye reverend sages, all of whom are to me as Brahma; ye greatly blessed who \nshine in this place of sacrifice with the splendour of the solar fire: ye who have concluded the silent meditations and have fed \nthe holy fire; and yet who are sitting--without care, what, O ye Dwijas (twice-born), shall I repeat, shall I recount the sacred \nstories collected in the Puranas containing precepts of religious duty and of worldly profit, or the acts of illustrious saints and \nsovereigns of mankind?\" \n \n\"The Rishi replied, 'The Purana, first promulgated by the great Rishi Dwaipayana, and which after having been heard both by \nthe gods and the Brahmarshis was highly esteemed, being the most eminent narrative that exists, diversified both in diction and \ndivision, possessing subtile meanings logically combined, and gleaned from the Vedas, is a sacred work. Composed in elegant \nlanguage, it includeth the subjects of other books. It is elucidated by other Shastras, and comprehendeth the sense of the four \nVedas.

Some bards have \nalready published this history, some are now teaching it, and others, in like manner, will hereafter promulgate it upon the earth. \nIt is a great source of knowledge, established throughout the three regions of the world. It is possessed by the twice-born both \nin detailed and compendious forms. It is the delight of the learned for being embellished with elegant expressions, \nconversations human and divine, and a variety of poetical measures. \n \nIn this world, when it was destitute of brightness and light, and enveloped all around in total darkness, there came into being, as \nthe primal cause of creation, a mighty egg, the one inexhaustible seed of all created beings. It is called Mahadivya, and was \nformed at the beginning of the Yuga, in which we are told, was the true light Brahma, the eternal one, the wonderful and \ninconceivable being present alike in all places; the invisible and subtile cause, whose nature partaketh of entity and non-entity. \nFrom this egg came out the lord Pitamaha Brahma, the one only Prajapati; with Suraguru and Sthanu. Then appeared the \ntwenty-one Prajapatis, viz., Manu, Vasishtha and Parameshthi; ten Prachetas, Daksha, and the seven sons of Daksha. Then \nappeared the man of inconceivable nature whom all the Rishis know and so the Viswe-devas, the Adityas, the Vasus, and the \ntwin Aswins; the Yakshas, the Sadhyas, the Pisachas, the Guhyakas, and the Pitris. After these were produced the wise and \nmost holy Brahmarshis, and the numerous Rajarshis distinguished by every noble quality. So the water, the heavens, the earth, \nthe air, the sky, the points of the heavens, the years, the seasons, the months, the fortnights, called Pakshas, with day and night \nin due succession. And thus were produced all things which are known to mankind. \n \nAnd what is seen in the universe, whether animate or inanimate, of created things, will at the end of the world, and after the \nexpiration of the Yuga, be again confounded. And, at the commencement of other Yugas, all things will be renovated, and, like \nthe various fruits of the earth, succeed each other in the due order of their seasons. Thus continueth perpetually to revolve in \nthe world, without beginning and without end, this wheel which causeth the destruction of all things. \n \nThe generation of Devas, in brief, was thirty-three thousand, thirty-three hundred and thirty-three. The sons of Div were \nBrihadbhanu, Chakshus, Atma Vibhavasu, Savita, Richika, Arka, Bhanu, Asavaha, and Ravi. Of these Vivaswans of old, \nMahya was the youngest whose son was Deva-vrata.
